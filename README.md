# beat-time-scroll-pack-clock
A clock that displays the time in the largely defunt Swatch @beat.time on a Pi Pico with a Pimoroni Scroll Pack.
You will require a Pi Pico with Wifi capabilities (such as the Pi Pico 2W) as it syncs over the internet. Sadly the timezone offset is not automatic so please adjust the timezone variable. It is set to GMT by default.

This was a fun little programming challenge I did for a friend. I hope someone else can enjoy it too. I get the numbers are a little hard to read but I think it worked well enough. I have seen some screen issues when the programme is left running for a while but I believe that's more the scroll pack being weird over the code being wrong. Do let me know if you see any problems.
